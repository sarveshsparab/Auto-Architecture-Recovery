{"id":"5a29daedeb5ac7e9e2af87ce1a7bbfad230d5c86","message":"ZOOKEEPER-2792 ZOOKEEPER-1045: Port implementation from branch-3.4 to branch-3.5.\n\nThis pull request implements SASL based server to server authentication and authorization based on the code changes made as part of ZOOKEEPER-1045 to branch-3.4. All unit tests (minors the known flaky ones) should pass now.\n\nThe main obstacle of the ports is code base difference between branch-3.4 and 3.5 with major new features (e.g. dynamic reconfiguration). The port itself does not add new features - i.e. how servers with authenticate with each other with the presence of dynamic reconfiguration. That work will be covered by a separate pull request targeting ZOOKEEPER-2793 and ZOOKEEPER-2794.\n\nAuthor: Michael Han <hanm@apache.org>\n\nReviewers: Rakesh Radhakrishnan <rakeshr@apache.org>\n\nCloses #272 from hanm/ZOOKEEPER-2792\n","affectedFiles":["org.apache.zookeeper.SaslClientCallbackHandler","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.NullQuorumAuthLearner","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.NullQuorumAuthServer","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumAuth","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumAuthLearner","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumAuthServer","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.SaslQuorumAuthLearner","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.SaslQuorumAuthServer","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.SaslQuorumServerCallbackHandler","org.apache.zookeeper.util.SecurityUtils","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.KerberosSecurityTestcase","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.KerberosTestUtils","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.MiniKdc","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.MiniKdcTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumAuthTestBase","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumAuthUpgradeTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumDigestAuthTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumKerberosAuthTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.auth.QuorumKerberosHostBasedAuthTest","org.apache.zookeeper.Login","org.apache.zookeeper.client.ZooKeeperSaslClient","org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperSaslServer","org.apache.zookeeper.server.auth.SaslServerCallbackHandler","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.FastLeaderElection","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Follower","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Leader","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Learner","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.LearnerHandler","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Observer","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumCnxManager","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeer","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerMain","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.EphemeralNodeDeletionTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.FLEBackwardElectionRoundTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.FLELostMessageTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.LearnerHandlerTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.LearnerTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerTestBase","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.RaceConditionTest","org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.Zab1_0Test","org.apache.zookeeper.test.CnxManagerTest","org.apache.zookeeper.test.FLEPredicateTest"],"affectedFilesCount":43,"analysedMsg":["minor","separate","Port","Rakesh","main","Radhakrishnan","zookeeper-2794","zookeeper-2793","272","cover","-lrb-","sasl","major","Michael","implement","presence","obstacle","add","test","<rakeshr@apache.org>","pass","author","work","hanm/zookeeper","unit","branch-3","port","3.5","Reviewers","i.e.","request","server","authenticate","code","flaky","part","reconfiguration","zookeeper-1045","feature","-rrb-","-2792","dynam","close","make","authentication","differ","target","<hanm@apache.org>","pull","Han","zookeeper-2792","chang","e.g.","base"],"issueId":"ZOOKEEPER-2792","commitURL":"https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/tree/5a29daedeb5ac7e9e2af87ce1a7bbfad230d5c86","secFilesCount":21}
